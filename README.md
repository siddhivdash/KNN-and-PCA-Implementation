Introduction
This repository provides Python implementations of KNN and PCA, along with examples demonstrating their use on sample datasets. The code is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear comments and modular structure. Whether you're working on classification tasks with KNN or dimensionality reduction with PCA, this repository serves as a practical resource for understanding and applying these algorithms.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space or predicts a value by averaging the values of the nearest neighbors. KNN is widely used in applications like pattern recognition, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection.
How KNN Works

Input Data: Given a dataset with labeled data points (features and corresponding classes/values).
Choose k: Select the number of neighbors (k) to consider. This is a hyperparameter that impacts model performance.
Distance Calculation: For a new data point, calculate its distance to all points in the dataset using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance).
Identify Neighbors: Select the k closest data points (neighbors) based on the calculated distances.
Prediction:
For classification, assign the class that is most common among the k neighbors (majority voting).
For regression, compute the average (or weighted average) of the neighbors' values.


Output: Return the predicted class or value.

Advantages and Disadvantages of KNN
Advantages:

Simple to understand and implement.
No training phase, making it a lazy learning algorithm.
Works well with small datasets and non-linear data.
Adaptable to both classification and regression tasks.

Disadvantages:

Computationally expensive during prediction, especially with large datasets.
Sensitive to the choice of k and the distance metric.
Struggles with high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality.
Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance (information) as possible. It is commonly used for data visualization, noise reduction, and improving the performance of machine learning models by reducing overfitting.
How PCA Works

Standardize the Data: Scale the features to have zero mean and unit variance to ensure equal contribution from all features.
Compute the Covariance Matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix to understand the relationships between features.
Eigenvalue Decomposition: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions (principal components) of maximum variance, and eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of variance along each direction.
Select Principal Components: Choose the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues to form a new feature space.
Project the Data: Transform the original data onto the new feature space by projecting it onto the selected principal components.
Output: The transformed data has fewer dimensions but retains most of the original information.

Advantages and Disadvantages of PCA
Advantages:

Reduces dimensionality, making data easier to visualize and process.
Mitigates the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional datasets.
Removes correlated features, improving model performance.
Helps reduce noise by focusing on components with the highest variance.

Disadvantages:

Assumes linear relationships in the data, which may not always hold.
Loss of interpretability, as principal components are linear combinations of original features.
Requires standardized data to work effectively.
Sensitive to outliers, which can skew the principal components.
