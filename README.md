## üîç K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### What is KNN?

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its *k* nearest neighbors in the feature space, or predicts a value by averaging the values of the neighbors.

**Applications:** Pattern recognition, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, etc.

### How KNN Works

1. **Input Data:** Dataset with labeled data points (features and corresponding classes/values).
2. **Choose k:** Select the number of neighbors *(k)* to consider.
3. **Distance Calculation:** Use a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) to compute distances to all points.
4. **Identify Neighbors:** Select the *k* closest data points.
5. **Prediction:**
   - Classification: Assign the most common class (majority voting).
   - Regression: Average the neighbors' values.
6. **Output:** Return the predicted class or value.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of KNN

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and implement.
- No training phase (lazy learning).
- Effective with small and non-linear datasets.
- Works for both classification and regression.

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive at prediction time.
- Sensitive to choice of *k* and distance metric.
- Struggles with high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality).
- Sensitive to noise and outliers.

## üìâ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### What is PCA?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a **dimensionality reduction** technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.

**Applications:** Data visualization, noise reduction, overfitting prevention, feature extraction.

### How PCA Works

1. **Standardize Data:** Scale features to zero mean and unit variance.
2. **Compute Covariance Matrix:** Capture feature relationships.
3. **Eigen Decomposition:** Find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
4. **Select Components:** Choose top *k* eigenvectors (principal components).
5. **Project Data:** Transform original data onto the selected components.
6. **Output:** Reduced-dimensionality data retaining essential information.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of PCA

**Advantages:**
- Reduces dimensionality and computational cost.
- Helps visualize high-dimensional data.
- Removes feature correlation.
- Reduces noise by focusing on important variance.

**Disadvantages:**
- Assumes linear relationships.
- Reduced interpretability (principal components are combinations of features).
- Requires standardized data.
- Sensitive to outliers.
